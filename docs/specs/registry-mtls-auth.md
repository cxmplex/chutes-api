# Feature Spec: chutes-api — Attestation CA Registration + Registry mTLS Auth

**Date**: 2026-05-31
**Status**: historical upstream design; reconciled implementation differs as described below

---

## Remediation reconciliation (authoritative)

The remediation cohort preserves stricter authority contracts than the original design in this
document:

- Provisioning routes use the immutable registered `server_id`, consume the existing
  server/certificate/measurement-bound capability, and issue monotonic generation leases. They do
  not restore the older ambiguous VM-name or pending-key flow.
- A CA-authenticated registry connection proves transport identity only. It never grants broad
  registry access. Every certificate-presenting request must also carry a current exact registry
  session whose method, repository, manifest/descriptor closure, and launch identity are checked;
  broad runtime sessions are rejected.
- The registry caller address is the direct peer address resolved by trusted proxy middleware.
  Forwarded caller-controlled headers are not an authority source.
- Pre-cutoff VMs may retain the explicitly gated legacy miner-signature path. At and above the
  configured cutoff, missing mTLS or an exact registry session fails closed.

The remaining sections describe the upstream feature's motivation and migration history. Where
they conflict with this reconciliation or current code, the bullets above and current tests are
authoritative.

## Context

Companion to [`docs/specs/vm-root-ca-registry-mtls.md`](vm-root-ca-registry-mtls.md), which covers the sek8s VM side. This spec covers the validator API (`chutes-api`) and infrastructure changes required to support per-VM mTLS for registry pulls.

On every boot, a sek8s VM generates a fresh RSA CA keypair in initramfs (RTMR2-measured), presents it as its single mTLS client identity, and records it with the validator via `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` (the RTMR3-attested runtime call), then uses that CA to sign both the attestation proxy's server cert and a short-lived leaf `clientAuth` cert for registry pulls. The validator must:

1. Record the per-VM CA cert from the runtime `/provision` call (never at boot).
2. Verify registry pull requests: a VM whose attested measurement version is `>= registry_mtls_min_version` must present a leaf client cert signed by its stored CA; older VMs use legacy SS58 header auth. The path is selected by the VM's attested version, not merely by the presence of a CA/cert.
3. Maintain backwards compatibility with old VMs that continue pulling with SS58 header auth (they are below the min version).
4. Verify the attestation proxy's server cert against the stored CA instead of accepting any cert (`ssl.CERT_NONE`).

- **Packages affected**: `chutes-api` (server model, server router, registry proxy, attestation proxy client)
- **Key files** (chutes-api):
  - `api/server/router.py` — `POST /{vm_name}/provision` + `/provision/confirm` routes (`provision`, `provision_confirm`); legacy `/luks/attest` + `/luks/confirm` (deprecated)
  - `api/server/schemas.py` — `vm_root_ca_cert` column on the `Server` model; `ProvisionRequest` / `ProvisionResponse`
  - `api/server/service.py` — `process_provision_request`, `record_vm_ca_identity`, `_issue_storage_secrets` (shared with legacy luks/attest), `lookup_server_by_ip`
  - `api/server/util.py` — `verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca`, `extract_client_cert` / `extract_optional_client_cert`, `get_public_key_hash`, `require_registry_proxy_secret`
  - `api/registry/router.py` — dual-auth handler (`registry_auth`)
  - `api/server/client.py` — attestation proxy TLS verification update
  - `charts/templates/registry-proxy-cm.yaml` — registry-proxy nginx (`ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca`, header forwarding)
- **Dependencies**: existing TDX quote verification logic (same RTMR3 check used in `POST /servers` and `luks/attest`)

---

## Design Decisions

- **Single CA identity, recorded at `/provision` (idempotent, every boot)**: The VM presents its one root CA as the mTLS client cert throughout boot, and the runtime `POST /provision` call upserts `vm_root_ca_cert` on the server record — same cert is a no-op; a new per-boot CA replaces the previous value. This folds CA registration into the storage-provisioning call instead of a dedicated `PUT`; the throwaway boot client cert and the separate endpoint are both eliminated.

- **mTLS with the CA cert as the client credential**: The VM uses the CA cert/key as its TLS client certificate. Completing the mTLS handshake proves possession of the CA private key, so the presented client cert IS the CA to record — nothing is repeated in the body. The `ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca` config already handles self-signed / per-VM-CA certs.

- **TDX quote binds CA pubkey (with a nonce)**: The `/provision` runtime quote's `REPORTDATA` is `luks_quote_nonce ‖ SHA256(client_cert pubkey)` — the same construction `luks/attest` uses. Because the client cert IS the CA, the standard `cert_hash` check already binds the CA pubkey, proving it was generated by measured initramfs code on TDX hardware — and the boot-issued nonce adds anti-replay (the retired `PUT /vm-root-ca` quote had none). Only after quote verification is the CA recorded.

- **Registry dual-auth, gated by attested version**: The registry-proxy nginx requests client certs but does not fail on absence (`ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca`). The `/registry/auth` handler resolves the VM by source IP (`X-Real-IP`) and branches on the VM's **attested measurement version**:
  - `server.version >= registry_mtls_min_version` (default `1.4.0`) → **mTLS required**: the presented leaf (`X-Client-Cert`) must be signed by the VM's stored CA. There is **no legacy fallback** for a VM this new — a missing cert or missing stored CA is a `401`.
  - otherwise (older VM, unknown IP, or no attested version) → **legacy** Bittensor hotkey/signature/nonce auth (unchanged from today).
  - Setting `registry_mtls_min_version = "0.0.0"` is the **kill switch**: it forces every attested VM onto mTLS, retiring the legacy "any registered miner can pull any private chute" path once the fleet has migrated. The two paths co-exist during migration; the min-version knob (not a hardcoded date) controls the cutover.

- **Registry proxy secret (`REGISTRY_PROXY_SECRET`)**: `/registry/auth` trusts `X-Client-Cert` and `X-Real-IP` only because the registry proxy set them. `require_registry_proxy_secret` optionally enforces that the request carried `X-Registry-Proxy-Auth` matching the secret, blocking someone who reaches `/registry/auth` off-proxy from spoofing those headers. It is a no-op until the secret is provisioned (optional hardening enabled after the LB cutover — see [`registry-lb-cutover.md`](../../local/registry-lb-cutover.md)).

- **VM IP lookup for registry auth**: The handler identifies the VM by source IP via `lookup_server_by_ip(X-Real-IP)`. `X-Real-IP` is the real client IP only when the registry-proxy Service uses `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` (post-cutover); under `Cluster` the source is SNAT'd and every VM falls back to legacy auth.

- **Attestation proxy client: stop using `ssl.CERT_NONE`**: Once a VM has registered its CA (`vm_root_ca_cert` non-null), the validator's outbound connection to that VM's attestation proxy verifies the server cert against the stored CA (`ssl_context.load_verify_locations(cadata=vm_root_ca_cert)`, `CERT_REQUIRED`, `check_hostname=False`). VMs without a stored CA fall back to `ssl.CERT_NONE`. Opt-in per VM, not a flag-day change.

- **Client cert verification against the stored CA cert**: The validator does not add per-VM CAs to a global trust store. `verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca` parses the stored CA PEM, requires the leaf's issuer to equal the CA subject, **rejects self-signed leaves** (`issuer == subject`), and verifies the leaf signature against the CA public key (ECDSA or RSA PKCS#1 v1.5). This avoids trust-store management for thousands of per-VM CAs.

## API Changes

### Runtime endpoint: `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision`

The CA is **not** recorded by a dedicated call. A new VM presents its root CA as the mTLS
client cert on the RTMR3-attested runtime provisioning call (`POST /provision`), whose quote
already binds `SHA256(client_cert pubkey)` with an anti-replay nonce — so recording the CA and
issuing storage secrets happen together, and there is no separate `PUT /vm-root-ca` endpoint.
(Legacy in-field VMs stay on `POST /luks/attest`, which records no CA.)

**Request**

```
POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision
X-Chutes-Hotkey: <miner_hotkey_ss58>
X-Chutes-Nonce: <luks_quote_nonce>
Content-Type: application/json
(mTLS client cert: the VM root CA cert itself)

{
  "quote":   "<base64-encoded TDX runtime quote>",
  "volumes": ["storage", "tdx-cache"]
}
```

**Auth & guards** (FastAPI dependencies):
- `X-Chutes-Hotkey` + `vm_name` identify the server record `(miner_hotkey, vm_name)`.
- `require_attestation_proxy()` — request must carry `X-Attestation-Proxy-Auth` matching `ATTESTATION_PROXY_SECRET`
  (so `X-Client-Cert` is trustworthy). Fails closed: if `ATTESTATION_PROXY_SECRET` is unset, every request is rejected.
- `extract_client_cert()` — parses the mTLS client cert (the VM root CA) from `X-Client-Cert`.
- `require_luks_quote_nonce` — validates + consumes the single-use runtime nonce issued by boot attestation.

**Validation steps** (`process_provision_request`):

1. Extract the mTLS client cert (the CA) — handled by `extract_client_cert`; `400` if malformed.
2. `verify_quote(quote, quote_nonce, SHA256(client_cert pubkey))` — the standard runtime check:
   nonce match, `REPORTDATA[64:128] == SHA256(client_cert pubkey)`, TDX signature, and all RTMR
   measurements incl. the runtime RTMR3 baseline. `403`/`400` on failure. No bespoke quote logic —
   the CA is just the presented cert, so the existing `cert_hash` mechanism proves possession.
3. `record_vm_ca_identity` — `get_server_by_name` (`404` if not found) → upsert
   `server.vm_root_ca_cert` = client cert PEM (idempotent every boot).
4. `_issue_storage_secrets` — rotate volume passphrases, manage the k3s key, issue a confirm nonce.
5. Return `200` `ProvisionResponse {volumes, k3s_encryption_key, confirm_nonce}`.

`POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision/confirm` promotes/discards the pending passphrases via the
shared `process_luks_confirm` (same as legacy `/luks/confirm`), gated by `require_confirm_nonce`.

**SECURITY INVARIANT**: `vm_root_ca_cert` is recorded ONLY from `/provision` (runtime, RTMR3
measured) — never from boot attestation, whose quotes validate against RTMR3 = 0.

### Schema changes

Add `vm_root_ca_cert` to the `Server` model (nullable, to maintain compatibility with pre-migration VMs):

```python
# Per-VM root CA cert recorded via POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision.
# NULL means the VM has not yet provisioned (pre-migration or old image) -> legacy auth path.
vm_root_ca_cert = Column(Text, nullable=True)
```

The **full PEM X.509 CA cert** is stored (not just the pubkey), so it can be used directly as a trust anchor by `verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca` (registry pulls) and `ssl_context.load_verify_locations(cadata=...)` (attestation proxy client). The pubkey is derived from it as needed for the REPORTDATA hash.

**Migration**: Single nullable `TEXT` column addition (`api/migrations/20260531120000_vm_root_ca_cert.sql`). No data migration — existing rows get `NULL`, which triggers the legacy auth path.

### Registry-proxy nginx (`registry.chutes.ai`)

The registry-proxy nginx (`charts/templates/registry-proxy-cm.yaml`) fronts Depot and calls the API's `/registry/auth` via `auth_request`. Relevant config:

- `ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca` — requests a client cert but never *requires* one, so a cert-less legacy containerd handshake still completes. The per-VM CA is registered dynamically, so nginx does **not** chain-validate the leaf; the API verifies it against the stored CA.
- The `/auth` subrequest forwards the material the handler needs:

```nginx
location = /auth {
    internal;
    proxy_pass http://api.<ns>.svc.cluster.local:8000/registry/auth;
    proxy_set_header X-Chutes-Hotkey       $http_x_chutes_hotkey;
    proxy_set_header X-Chutes-Signature    $http_x_chutes_signature;
    proxy_set_header X-Chutes-Nonce        $http_x_chutes_nonce;
    # Cert negotiated in the TLS handshake (NOT a client-supplied header). Empty for legacy VMs.
    proxy_set_header X-Client-Cert         $ssl_client_escaped_cert;
    # Prove the request arrived via this proxy so the API can trust X-Client-Cert / X-Real-IP.
    proxy_set_header X-Registry-Proxy-Auth "${REGISTRY_PROXY_SECRET}";
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP             $remote_addr;
    ...
}
```

`X-Real-IP` is the real client IP only under `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` (post LB-cutover). There is no cert-subject-DN pre-filter — the auth gate is the application handler. See [`registry-lb-cutover.md`](../../local/registry-lb-cutover.md) for the front-door topology.

### Registry backend auth handler (`api/registry/router.py`)

`GET /registry/auth` — called by the nginx `auth_request`; a `200` authorizes the pull, anything else blocks it. The proxy-secret guard and typed cert extraction are FastAPI dependencies; the version gate selects the auth path:

```python
@router.get("/auth")
async def registry_auth(
    request: Request,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db_session),
    _proxy=Depends(require_registry_proxy_secret()),                 # X-Registry-Proxy-Auth (if configured)
    client_cert: Optional[Certificate] = Depends(extract_optional_client_cert()),
):
    client_ip = request.headers.get("X-Real-IP") or (request.client.host if request.client else None)
    server = await lookup_server_by_ip(db, client_ip) if client_ip else None

    if server and server.version and semcomp(server.version, settings.registry_mtls_min_version) >= 0:
        # mTLS required — no legacy fallback for a VM this new.
        if client_cert is None or not server.vm_root_ca_cert:
            raise HTTPException(401, "VM must authenticate via a valid mTLS client certificate.")
        verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca(client_cert, server.vm_root_ca_cert)
    else:
        await _legacy_registry_auth(request)   # Bittensor hotkey/signature/nonce (unchanged)

    return {"authenticated": True}
```

`verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca(leaf: Certificate, ca_cert_pem: str)` parses the stored CA PEM, rejects self-signed leaves, requires `leaf.issuer == ca.subject`, and verifies the leaf signature against the CA public key. Raises `HTTPException(403)` on failure.

### Attestation proxy client (`api/server/client.py`)

`_attestation_session` verifies the VM's attestation-proxy server cert against the stored CA when one is registered; otherwise it keeps the pre-migration `CERT_NONE` behaviour (authenticity is instead checked out-of-band via the TDX quote's REPORTDATA hash):

```python
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()
ssl_context.check_hostname = False
if self.server.vm_root_ca_cert:
    ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
    ssl_context.load_verify_locations(cadata=self.server.vm_root_ca_cert)  # stored full PEM cert
else:
    ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
```

`load_verify_locations(cadata=...)` takes the stored full PEM cert directly — no temp file — which is why `vm_root_ca_cert` stores the full X.509 cert rather than just the extracted public key.

---

## Goal

Success =

1. `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` returns `200` and records `vm_root_ca_cert` for a valid request from a registered VM with a valid runtime quote where `REPORTDATA[64:128] = SHA256(client_cert pubkey)` and the nonce matches; it also returns rotated volumes + k3s key + confirm nonce.
2. A registry pull from a VM attested `>= registry_mtls_min_version`, presenting a leaf cert signed by its recorded CA, succeeds; the same pull with no client cert (or no stored CA) is rejected with `401` — a VM this new gets **no** legacy fallback.
3. A registry pull from a VM below the min version (or with no attested version) using legacy Bittensor auth headers continues to succeed unchanged.
4. A request presenting a leaf cert signed by a **different** CA than the one stored in the DB is rejected with `403`.
5. A `/provision` request with a tampered TDX quote (wrong RTMR3, wrong REPORTDATA, or wrong nonce) is rejected; legacy `/luks/attest` records **no** CA.
6. Outbound connections from the validator to a VM's attestation proxy use the stored CA cert for server cert verification when `vm_root_ca_cert` is non-null; VMs without it fall back to the prior `ssl.CERT_NONE` path.
7. No re-provisioning or re-registration of existing VMs required — they migrate to mTLS automatically on first boot of the new image; `registry_mtls_min_version = "0.0.0"` is the kill switch that retires legacy auth once migration completes.

---

## Constraints

- `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` must verify the runtime TDX quote (nonce + cert_hash + all RTMR incl. RTMR3) via the same `verify_quote` pipeline as `luks/attest`. Do not record a CA without a verified quote.
- The CA is recorded ONLY from `/provision` (runtime, RTMR3 measured) — never from boot attestation (RTMR3 = 0). Do not add CA storage to the boot handler.
- The CA cert is taken directly from the mTLS client cert in the TLS handshake (the handshake proves key possession); there is no separate body copy, so no reconciliation is needed.
- The registry dual-auth logic must be non-breaking for VMs below the min version. VMs with no attested version, an unknown source IP, or `version < registry_mtls_min_version` must follow the legacy auth path without error. A VM `>= registry_mtls_min_version` must **not** silently fall back to legacy (missing cert / missing stored CA → `401`).
- `verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca` must not accept self-signed leaf certs (the leaf's issuer must equal the CA subject, and the signature must verify against the CA pubkey — it is not sufficient for the leaf cert to just be parseable).
- `X-Client-Cert`/`X-Real-IP` are trusted only from the registry proxy. When `REGISTRY_PROXY_SECRET` is set, `require_registry_proxy_secret` rejects requests lacking the matching `X-Registry-Proxy-Auth`; the mTLS attestation endpoints are likewise gated by `require_attestation_proxy`. The backend must not trust these headers on a connection that bypassed the proxy.
- The attestation proxy client must not log the CA cert PEM or any key material.
- Store the full CA cert (the mTLS client cert from the handshake), not just the extracted public key, to enable use as a CA trust anchor in the attestation proxy client.

---

## Output Format

1. **DB migration**: add `vm_root_ca_cert TEXT NULL` column to the `servers` table (or equivalent ORM model). No default, nullable.

2. **`POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` + `/provision/confirm` routes** — in the server router:
   - Request models: `ProvisionRequest(quote: str, volumes: list[str])`; confirm reuses `LuksConfirmRequest`.
   - `provision` deps: `require_attestation_proxy()`, `extract_client_cert()`, `require_luks_quote_nonce`; calls `process_provision_request` → `verify_quote(quote, nonce, SHA256(client_cert pubkey))` → `record_vm_ca_identity` (upsert `vm_root_ca_cert` = client cert PEM) → `_issue_storage_secrets`.
   - Response model: `ProvisionResponse {volumes, k3s_encryption_key, confirm_nonce}`.
   - `provision_confirm` deps: `require_attestation_proxy()`, `require_confirm_nonce`; delegates to the shared `process_luks_confirm`.

3. **`verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca(leaf: Certificate, ca_cert_pem: str) -> None`** utility — takes the already-parsed leaf `Certificate` and the stored CA PEM; uses `cryptography`; raises `HTTPException(403)` on failure. Suitable for unit testing in isolation.

4. **Registry auth handler (`registry_auth`)** — resolves the VM by `X-Real-IP`, branches on the attested `version` vs `registry_mtls_min_version`: mTLS (`verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca`) at/above, legacy Bittensor auth below. Gated by `require_registry_proxy_secret` and `extract_optional_client_cert` dependencies.

5. **`_attestation_session` in `api/server/client.py`** — replaces bare `ssl.CERT_NONE`; `load_verify_locations(cadata=vm_root_ca_cert)` + `CERT_REQUIRED` when a CA is registered, falls back to `CERT_NONE` for pre-migration VMs.

6. **registry-proxy nginx (`registry-proxy-cm.yaml`)** — `ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca`; the `/auth` subrequest forwards `X-Client-Cert` (`$ssl_client_escaped_cert`), `X-Real-IP`, and `X-Registry-Proxy-Auth`.

7. **Tests** (`tests/unit/test_registry_mtls_auth.py`, `test_mtls_enforcement.py`):
   - `test_provision_records_ca_and_returns_secrets` — valid client cert + valid quote → `vm_root_ca_cert` recorded, returns volumes/k3s/confirm_nonce
   - `test_provision_confirm_promotes_passphrases` — confirm delegates to shared `process_luks_confirm`
   - `test_luks_attest_records_no_ca` — legacy path rotates storage but never sets `vm_root_ca_cert`
   - `test_put_vm_root_ca_removed` — the old `PUT /servers/{vm}/vm-root-ca` route 404s
   - `test_registry_mtls_valid_leaf` / `test_registry_mtls_wrong_ca` — leaf signed by registered / different CA → allowed / 403
   - `test_registry_version_gate_allows_old_vm` — VM below min version uses legacy auth
   - `test_registry_version_gate_rejects_new_vm_without_mtls` — VM ≥ min version, no cert → 401, no legacy fallback
   - `test_registry_kill_switch_forces_mtls` — min version `0.0.0` forces mTLS for every attested VM
   - `test_registry_legacy_no_ca_registered` — VM below min version, valid legacy auth → allowed
   - `test_verify_leaf_cert_signed_by_ca_*` — verification function unit tests (valid / wrong CA / self-signed / malformed CA)
   - `require_attestation_proxy` / `require_registry_proxy_secret` — proxy-guard unit tests in `test_mtls_enforcement.py`

---

## Failure Conditions

- `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` records a CA without a valid runtime TDX quote, or records one at boot attestation (RTMR3 = 0) instead of only at `/provision`.
- Registry allows a pull using a client cert signed by a CA that does not match the stored `vm_root_ca_cert` for that VM's IP.
- A VM attested `>= registry_mtls_min_version` is allowed to fall back to legacy auth (must be `401` when it lacks a valid mTLS cert).
- Registry rejects a pull from a below-min-version VM that correctly presents legacy auth headers (regression in legacy path).
- `vm_root_ca_cert` stored as extracted pubkey bytes instead of full PEM cert — breaks `load_verify_locations` in the attestation proxy client.
- Attestation proxy client logs CA cert PEM or any portion of key material.
- The validator begins enforcing server cert verification on attestation proxy connections for VMs that have not yet registered a CA (`vm_root_ca_cert = NULL`) — must fall back to `CERT_NONE` for those VMs.
- `X-Client-Cert` / `X-Real-IP` trusted off-proxy — when `REGISTRY_PROXY_SECRET` is set, a request lacking a valid `X-Registry-Proxy-Auth` must be rejected, so an attacker reaching `/registry/auth` directly cannot spoof the source IP or client cert.
- Migration requires re-running `POST /servers` for any existing VM.

---

## Rollout Notes

- **Deployment order**:
  1. Deploy DB migration (`vm_root_ca_cert` column, nullable). All existing rows get `NULL` — legacy auth path unchanged.
  2. Deploy `POST /servers/{vm_name}/provision` (+ `/provision/confirm`) + registry dual-auth handler + registry-proxy nginx (`ssl_verify_client optional_no_ca`, header forwarding). With `registry_mtls_min_version` above the whole fleet's attested version, every VM still takes the legacy path.
  3. Front `registry.chutes.ai` with the registry-proxy Service LB and flip `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` so `X-Real-IP` is the real VM IP (see [`registry-lb-cutover.md`](../../local/registry-lb-cutover.md)). Optionally enable `REGISTRY_PROXY_SECRET` hardening once stable.
  4. Deploy new VM image (sek8s). As each VM reboots at `version >= registry_mtls_min_version`, it records its CA via `POST .../provision` and presents mTLS leaf certs; the version gate routes it to the mTLS path.
  5. Once the fleet has migrated, set `registry_mtls_min_version = "0.0.0"` (kill switch) to force mTLS for every attested VM and retire legacy auth.
  6. Deploy the updated attestation proxy client (`_attestation_session`) once registry rollout is confirmed stable.

- **No forced re-provisioning**: existing VMs migrate automatically on next reboot. Zero miner action required.

- **Rollback**: raise `registry_mtls_min_version` back above the fleet (or set a VM row's `vm_root_ca_cert = NULL`) to return traffic to the legacy path without any VM-side change.

- **Legacy path sunset**: after the kill switch is on and stable, the legacy Bittensor auth path and the chutes-miner registry DaemonSet can be removed in a follow-on change.

- **REPORTDATA format**: the VM generates `ca_pub_hash` as `sha256sum` hex output of the DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo bytes. The validator must derive the pubkey in the same way: `SHA256(cert.public_key().public_bytes(Encoding.DER, PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo))` and compare to the hex in REPORTDATA (first 64 chars).
